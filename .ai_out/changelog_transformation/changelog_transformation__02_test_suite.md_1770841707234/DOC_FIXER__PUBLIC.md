# Phase 02: DOC_FIXER Report

## Documentation Updated

**CLAUDE.md / Local Docs:**
- `CLAUDE.md` line 81: Fixed stale step definitions reference from `features/steps/ticket_steps.py` to `features/steps/changelog_steps.py`

**Thorg Notes:**
- No thorg note references found in changed test files. No updates needed.

**No Updates Needed:**
- `README.md`: Testing section does not reference specific test filenames. No changes required. (Full README rewrite deferred to Phase 03.)
- `CLAUDE.md` feature file glob (`features/*.feature`) remains accurate -- no filename-specific references to update there.

## Verification

All 76 scenarios pass after the change (8 features, 394 steps, 0 failures).
